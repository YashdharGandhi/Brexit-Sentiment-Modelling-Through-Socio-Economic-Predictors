# Brexit Analysis Project

This repository contains the work for the MATH5743M: Statistical Learning assessed practical project, which focuses on analyzing Brexit-related data. The project demonstrates industry-standard practices in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and statistical modeling, ensuring reproducibility and clear presentation of results.

## Project Overview

The project aims to answer research questions about Brexit by:
- **Exploring** the structure and quality of the dataset.
- **Cleaning** and preprocessing the data.
- **Performing** exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and relationships.
- **Applying** statistical learning techniques to model key factors influencing Brexit outcomes.
- **Interpreting** the results to identify significant predictors and derive actionable insights.

## Dataset Description

- **File:** `Brexit_Data.csv`
- **Content:** The dataset contains Brexit-related variables such as demographic indicators, economic measures, and survey responses. It was used to examine the determinants of Brexit sentiment and the impact of various socio-economic factors.
- **Source:** Collected as part of the assessed practical for the Statistical Learning course.

## Tasks Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Normalizing and transforming variables for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables.
   - Identifying key trends and anomalies in the data.

3. **Statistical Modeling:**  
   - Building regression and classification models.
   - Validating model performance using cross-validation and other metrics.
   
4. **Results Interpretation:**  
   - Summarizing the impact of significant predictors.
   - Discussing the implications of the findings in the context of Brexit.

## Key Findings

- The analysis revealed that several economic and demographic factors are significant predictors of Brexit sentiment.
- Patterns identified in the exploratory analysis provided insights into regional and socioeconomic differences.
- The statistical models achieved robust performance, supporting the validity of the conclusions drawn from the data.

## Requirements

- **Software:**  
  - R (version 4.x or later)  
  - RStudio (recommended for interactive work)
- **R Packages:**  
  - `knitr` (for extracting and knitting the R Markdown file)  
  - Additional packages as required by the analysis (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, etc.)

## How to Run

1. **Review the Notebook:**  
   Open the R Markdown file (`Brexit_Analysis_Notebook.Rmd`) in RStudio to view the full analysis and narrative.

2. **Run the Analysis Code:**  
   If preferred, execute the extracted R script (`Brexit_Analysis_Code.R`) to reproduce the results.

3. **Data Access:**  
   Ensure that the dataset (`Brexit_Data.csv`) is located in the `data` folder as per the repository structure.
